Movie Recommendation System using FastAPI and Supervised Learning
Project Overview

This project implements a Movie Recommendation System built with Supervised Machine Learning and deployed using FastAPI. The system learns from historical movie-user data to predict user preferences and provide personalized movie recommendations through RESTful APIs.

The project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and production-ready API deployment.
